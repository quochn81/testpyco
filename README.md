# Complexity of problem 1
- In my code have use: 
1. one for loop complexity is O(n)
2. one map function complexity is O(n)
3. use two times assign data complexity is O(2)
4. Total complexity for rotation function is O(n^2 + 2) for one time rotation
5. If total times will rotation is m => complexityO(m*(n^2 +2))

# Complexity of problem 4
- In my code have use:
1. one for loop complexity is O(n)
2. one while loop complexity is O(n)
3. Total complexity for check_room function is O(n^2)
